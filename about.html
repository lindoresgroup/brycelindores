							<h2>ABOUT BRYCE LINDORES:</h2>
<p>Cyclist · Paralympian · World Cup Champion · Adventurer (Mt Kilimanjaro)</p>
<p>Paralympic Cyclist, World Champion, all-round great guy – these are just a few ways to describe 25-year-old Gold Coaster Bryce Lindores.<br>
The courage, strength and determination demonstrated by this remarkable young man, which has seen him achieve so much in these past few years, makes him an inspiration to all.</p>
<p>A keen sportsman before a tragic accident left him visually impaired in 2004 just days before</p>
<p>his 18th birthday, fun-loving Bryce has taken his new life by the horns, becoming a jet-setting, World Champion and Paralympian in a sport he wasn’t even experienced in before his accident thanks to a lot of hard work and dedication. His achievements could outshine even his able- bodied peers.</p>
<p>Bryce took up tandem cycling in 2006, just two years after a car accident left him completely blind.<br>
Tandem cycling enables a cyclist who is blind or has low vision to ride with a sighted “pilot”. Just six months into his cycling career, Bryce won a bronze medal at the 2006 Cycling World Championships, with pilot Steve Storer, and the same year was awarded the 2006 Queensland Tandem Cyclist of the Year.</p>
<p>After recently winning gold and becoming World Champion at the 2012 Track World Championships in Los Angeles, with pilot Scott McPhee, Bryce and current pilot Mark Jamieson are now in training for the London Paralympic Games later this year.<br>
Bryce says his career highlights include: winning bronze in the 4km individual pursuit in Beijing 2008, and winning gold and becoming world champion at the 2012 Track World Championships.</p>

<p><strong>BIOGRAPHY:</strong></p>
<p>Bryce Lindores<br>
Disability: Vision impaired<br>
How acquired: Car accident<br>
Date of Birth: 12/09/1986 Home: Nobby Beach, Queensland Started Competing: 2006</p>

<p>First Competed for Australia: 2006 Games Experience: Beijing 2008</p>
<p>In September 2004, just a few days shy of his 18th birthday, Bryce was like many other peers his age, preparing to sit for the Queensland Core Skills Test, to finish school, to attend</p>
<p>University, and making plans for his upcoming 18th birthday. The keen sportsman also enjoyed playing rugby, tennis, and touch football.</p>
<p>Tragedy struck during an afternoon catching up with mates at a friend’s Gold Coast property. “I’d just sat my exams that day and we were hanging out at a mate’s place on 20 acres,” Bryce says.<br>
“I was sitting in the back of a ute that was towing a broken-down car. The shackle [between the two vehicles] broke and it smashed through the windscreen, hit me in the head and blinded me instantly”.</p>
<p>Bryce says he was fortunate that the father of one of his friends, a Doctor with the Careflight Helicopter, was quickly able to lend assistance.<br>
“He had just returned from a job when he got the call. He got back in the chopper and came out to pick me up to transport me straight to Brisbane,” Bryce said.</p>
<p>Bryce spent six weeks in hospital recovering. He experienced headaches and had to have a shunt to drain fluid on the brain.<br>
During his recovery, and in the months after, Bryce said he spent a lot of time sleeping.<br>
“At first, in hospital, I did sleep a lot and had a weird sleeping pattern. The medical staff would come in at all hours to do checks so I often caught up on sleep during the day.”</p>
<p>Bryce says the support of his family and friends was invaluable.</p>
<p>Bryce was introduced to tandem cycling, a sport which enables a cyclist who is blind or has low vision to ride with a sighted “pilot”, by neighbour Russell Leary.<br>
“I was walking with a mate to my local Surf Club, and we bumped into Russell and began chatting.</p>
<p>A few days later, we caught up again. We then went on to become friends and he was the one who suggested I give tandem cycling a go, which I did and got better and better at it,” Bryce says.</p>
<p>Bryce took up tandem cycling in 2006, just two years after a car accident left him completely blind.<br>
Just six months into his cycling career, Bryce won a Bronze medal at the 2006 Cycling World Championships, with pilot Steve Storer, and the same year was awarded the 2006 Queensland Tandem Cyclist of the Year.</p>
<p>The sport has provided many great mental and physiological advantages.<br>
“Cycling has changed the way I think,” Bryce says. “I started to take it seriously in September 2006, then I went to the World Championships and won a Bronze”.</p>
<p>A-grade cyclist Steve George was Bryce’s pilot in 2008 at the Paralympics in Beijing.<br>
At the 2008 Paralympic Games, Bryce won a Bronze medal in the individual pursuit, something of which he is extremely proud. Together with his pilot Steven George, he took six</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>seconds off his personal best to score Bronze. His first Paralympic Games, Bryce loved the team atmosphere and enjoyed meeting and cheering on athletes from sports outside cycling.</p>
<p>Bryce enjoyed a stellar year in 2010, proving his talent on the road as well as the track with road race gold at the 2010 Road World Cup.<br>
In 2011, piloted by Sean Finning, Bryce won Bronze in the 4km individual pursuit at the 2011 World Track Championships. He also won Gold in the road time trial at the 2011 National Championships and Silver in the road race.</p>
<p>Buoyed by his stand out performances in Beijing 2008 and most recently at the 2012 Track World Championships where he won gold in the tandem 4km pursuit, with pilot Scott McPhee, Bryce enters London 2012 as a hot favourite.<br>
Bryce has now secured world champion cyclist Mark Jamieson, 27, as his pilot for his London Games campaign.</p>
<p>The pair are training together full time, with Mark recently relocating to the Gold Coast from Tasmania.<br>
“We’ll get to London with the confidence of knowing how much effort we have already put in,” Mark says.</p>
<p>“When it comes to race time, we nearly know what time we’re going to do, just by the training and preparation we do. We pretty much know the time, beforehand, within seconds,” Bryce said.<br>
“It puts us in a good place knowing that we can consistently ride that fast”.</p>
